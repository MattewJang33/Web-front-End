# Web-front-End
I practiced using javascript with the materials mady by wes bos.
The url for the materials is following below:
https://wesbos.com

I made all of the projects by myself by just googling from the scratch
Maybe there will be a lot of mistakes here and there so I recommend you watching the solution of wes bos, not mine.

Thanks
